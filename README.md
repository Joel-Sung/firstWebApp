# firstWebApp
My first web application.

Hello, welcome to my first attempt at a web application using MEAN stack.

I have created 2 applications, 

1. TeleBill: helps to split bills shared by friends / multiple people, and sends a consolidated bill as a telegram message where users can indicate if they have paid their share.
  Source code found in TeleBill file.
  App has to be accessed from link sent by my telegram bot 'Botsu'.
  
2. Mahjong chip tracker: helps to keep track of chips for a game of mahjong if you have no physical chips. The app also keeps track of the game statistics that you can track any time throughout the game.
   Souce code found in the mahjong file.
   Link can be obtained through my telegram bot 'Botsu'.
   
 'Telebot' file has some code for my telegram bot that does some silly stuff.
   
 To launch the web application, simply run 'npm start' in your command prompt from the root folder. The app will run on port 8000.
 
 Currently, I have a website https://joelsung.com/ that runs the web application.
 
 P.S. This is my first project, so it is mostly just for experience and having fun. It is probably very amateurish.
